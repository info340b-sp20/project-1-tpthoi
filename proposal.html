        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Many of upcoming freshman or current students doesn't know what type of majors they want to be in.
            Most of us switch majors at least once over the course of our college tenure. This is important
            for us students to get ahead and know what we want in order for us to be successful and graduate
            on time. While UW have a <a href="https://admit.washington.edu/academics/majors/" target="_blank">list of majors</a> 
            by the School, It isn't very helpful since it doesn't show the level of difficulty of getting in and you 
            actually have to dig for answers in order to find the requiremnent for one major and some doesn't even show admission
            cycle at all. My app will focus mainly on the majors itself and how to get ready for it.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                My propose Application is a calendar type of widget that has deadlines of admission cycle that is accessible to highschooler
                and current UW students. I will gathering data from the UW pages the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/uaa/advising/degree-overview/general-education/requirements-by-college-and-school/" target="_blank">General Education Requirements</a> 
                I will try to find the pre req for each major and attach to a link on the calendar where they can see it along with the admission date.
                The users will able to search for the major they want or scroll through the list to find the one that best fits the learning goals. Also it will have a
                summary of the majors and examples jobs that they can find along with.
            </p>

        <h2>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem?</h2>
            <p>
                My app will focus mainly on the majors itself and how to get ready for it.
                This will help students find the right majors as soon as possible without taking
                up so much of their time so they can plan their college schedule.
